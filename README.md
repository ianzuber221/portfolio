# 🧠 Ian Zuber – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the codebase for my personal developer portfolio — a smart, modern, and AI-powered site built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **OpenAI**. Designed to showcase not just what I’ve built, but *how* I think, this project is an evolving canvas for my work, creativity, and goals.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Fast & Modern Stack** — Built with Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and server components.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Customization** — Recruiter-focused personalization using OpenAI for:
  - Background generation
  - Website theming
  - Dynamic summaries of my GitHub projects
- 🎨 **Responsive Design** — Clean, minimalist layout with dark mode support and subtle 3D interactions.
- 🔍 **Smart Project Showcases** — Automatically pulls and summarizes my GitHub projects using OpenAI and the GitHub API.
- 💼 **Work Experience Integration** — Showcases professional work in a way that's compliant with NDAs (no links or screenshots).
- 🗂️ **Recruiter Session Storage** — Personalized experience persists across sessions.

### 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This project is more than a portfolio — it’s a personal experiment in creativity, tech, and interaction design. I’ve built this as a living resume, and a way to demonstrate not only what I can do, but what I love to do.
